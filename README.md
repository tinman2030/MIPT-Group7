McGill IPT Group 7, working on the water-based computer

## Idea
Making a large scale binary-bit adder to exhibit how possible 2^n trials of the subset sum problem. Contains:
  - scrapyard.py: random splices of code that don't really matter. Checking if functions work and what not
  - binary_adder package: soon to be populated by all of the things that we need to run this shit. Including a GUI, a binary converter and adder.
  - More to come...
